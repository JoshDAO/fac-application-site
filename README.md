# fac-application-site
This will be the website I build to apply to FAC20. It will contain an image carousel, and show who I am through my code.
I pair programmed with Lisa (https://licern.github.io/personal-website/) during the creation of the image-carousel and we shared ideas to tackle bugs with it.
