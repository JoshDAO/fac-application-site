                    My name is Josh and I am a bartender! For the last few years, I have been tinkering, mixing, shaking and tasting from Manchester to Melbourne, honing my skills 
                    and learning from other excellent industry friends. From creating new and exciting cocktails with home-made shrubs and foams, to reviving old, lost and forgotten tinctures
                    from centuries past - it is an industry I have thoroughly enjoyed being a part of. Over there in my <em>state of the art *cough*</em> image carousel, are a few shots of me doing my thing.
                    I never planned this career path, it was rather out of necessity; I wanted to be an astronaut throughout my childhood! (Okay I still do a little).
                    However, I found the theory and skills to be interesting, and eventually took up a training role within a bar, where I could share my knowledge and passion.

                    Outside of work, I have an interest in politics, particularly in the US as well as at home in the UK. A lot of this interest was spurred by the fascinating
                    and highly controversial use of technology in national elections/referenda in 2016 and onwards, which opened my eyes to the problems that we, as a population, 
                    face in an age where the personal data and social engineering industries are exponentially growing and legislation is not catching up.
                    <br>
                    It also showed me what we are capable of doing with technology, and how exciting the future is in this industry where the limit is our imagination.
                    I'm aiming to start a career where I can do what I do best - solving problems - and at the same time, make a difference to somebody else's life
                    through my work.

                    I've always had an interest in technology, and wanted to be able to program for a long time. I love mathematical problems and the logical thinking required
                    to solve them, so I started following a Ruby course on Flatiron. I loved learning the fundamentals of programming with Ruby, and it has sent me on many rabbit holes
                    since then. I created a CLI Tic-Tac-Toe game both <a href="https://github.com/jhart5/tic-tac-toe-rb-ruby-intro-000/blob/master/lib/tic_tac_toe.rb">procedurally</a>
                     and in <a href="https://github.com/jhart5/oo-tic-tac-toe-ruby-intro-000/blob/master/lib/tic_tac_toe.rb">object-orientation!</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then I started following The Odin Project's Web Development 101 course to get a taste of how the front-end of web development works, where I built a cosmetic replica 
                    of the <a href="https://jhart5.github.io/google-homepage/">Google homepage</a> (at the time I found just doing that to be quite difficult, and it was only a couple of months ago!)
                    This lead me to find out about FAC and completing the prerequisites, which I have thoroughly enjoyed every part of, and has challenged me to learn a great deal.

                    I thrive when I am being challenged and absolutely have some of that stubbornness in the face of repeated failure 
                    (<a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/jhart5/completed_solutions">see my preference for tougher Katas</a>). The
                    sweet moment when everything works makes it worth it every time!
                    I've also had my first experiences collaborating with others which was every bit as fun and productive as I'd hoped. <br><br>
                    I have found just how enjoyable coding is. It allows me to be creative in my solutions while thinking critically and following strict rules - but the more rules
                    I learn, the more creative I can be! I would like nothing more than the opportunity to continue to learn, collaborate, and solve on a full-time basis, and eventually 
                    become a part of such an exciting industry at the forefont of our society's advancement.

                    What drew me to Founders and Coders initially was the way in which the course is taught. The fact that learning is done through pair programming and
                    collaboration in teams sounds fantastic. I love being able to exchange ideas and find the work process much more enjoyable and inclusive when people 
                    freely share their knowledge and help others. I admire the reciprocal nature of the programme - I believe the idea of being mentored by somebody who so recently 
                    was in exactly my position would foster a certain empathy and understanding that can be difficult to find from a professional lecturer. On the other
                    hand, being able to mentor the next cohort and have the chance to make an impact on their development sounds delightful. I chose a path that put me into a 
                    training role in my current industry for exactly those reasons - I truly enjoy sharing knowledge in the things I am passionate about.

                    Since registering an interest and participating in the weekly meet-ups, it has been an absolutely refreshing experience that I look forward to every week.
                    It is clear that you insist on a very inclusive and safe environment, and as a result I have felt able to participate in discussion and ask or answer questions,
                    even when I am unsure of myself, in a class of people whom I don't know. Having
